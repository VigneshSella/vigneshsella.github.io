I'm currently a PhD AI/ML Resident at Google X. I am completing my PhD in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics program at the University of Texas at Austin with co-adivors [Prof. Karen Willcox](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/karen-willcox/) and [Dr. Anirban Chaudhuri @ MIT](https://sites.google.com/site/anirbanchaudhuri01/). My research has revolved around developing fast and data-efficient multi-fidelity ML models with applications in inverse problems and optimization for science & engineering. I have had the great privilige to be funded by and contribute to the following projects during my PhD: [DARPA ASKEM](https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction-and-modeling) & [ARPA-E LOADS](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/learning-optimal-aerodynamic-designs).
