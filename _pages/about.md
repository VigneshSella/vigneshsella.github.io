### About me
I have had the great privilge to experience a culturally diverse and globally oriented upbringing, residing in multiple cities spanning Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, listening to new music, football (soccer), and occausionally some video games. I am also a big believer in travelling and experiencing new cultures, having visited over 36 countries and counting! I hope to one day visit all the continents, including Antarctica, and eventually see the Earth from space. 

As for my educational background, I'm currently a PhD student in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (Computational/Applied Mathematics) program in the Oden Institute at UT Austin where I am advised by Dr. Karen Willcox and Dr. Anirban Chaudhuri (MIT). Prior to attending the University of Texas at Austin, I completed my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering with a minor in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

### Research interests
My research interests are primarily in data-driven modeling, uncertainty quantification, and optimization. I am personally interested in developing methods with immediate practical applicability, and have typically featured numerical examples from (but not limited to) aerospace engineering applications with costly high-fidelity models such as airfoil design, pressure field prediction, etc. I am always on the lookout for new applications to test the methods I have developed, and am open to collaborations in this regard - so feel free to reach out! 

Since I am working with data-driven methods, I am very careful with the presentation of the results and the replicability of the all the methods I report on, especially deep-learning based approaches. I am a firm believer in the reproducibility in scientific research, and thus all my code is typically available on my GitHub alongside the publication.
