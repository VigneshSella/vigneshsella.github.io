title: Development of a nytrox-paraffin hybrid rocket engine
categories: [publications, miscellaneous]
excerpt: Student-led project to develop a hybrid rocket engine using a novel Nytrox-paraffin oxidizer and fuel combination.
---

A hybrid rocket engine designed using a nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture (Nytrox) and paraffin, dubbed Eugene, was developed for a high-powered rocket by the Illinois Space Society, a chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The design objective is to provide 4000 N of thrust to propel a 4 kg payload to 10,000 ft, in order to compete at the Intercollegiate Rocketry and Engineering Competition. Furthermore, with this project students gain firsthand experience developing a novel oxidizer-fuel combination hybrid rocket engine.
